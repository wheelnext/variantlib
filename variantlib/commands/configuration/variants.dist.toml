# ============= Top-Most Priority ============= #

# 1. Define the priority of variant properties - 1st order priority.
#    => Expected format: "namespace::feature::value"
#
# OPTIONAL: In most cases - users will not specify the following. Only used when the user wants
#           to modify the default VariantProperty priority ordering.
#
# Note: This is a lazy-list: Only specify the ones you want to "bump up" to the top of the list

# 2. Define the priority of variant features - 2nd order priority under the variant properties.
#    => Expected format: "namespace::feature"
#
# OPTIONAL: In most cases - users will not specify the following. Only used when the user wants
#           to modify the default VariantFeature priority ordering.

# 3. Define the priority of variant namespaces
#    => Expected format: "namespace"
#
# MANDATORY AND IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ !
#    - As long as there is more than 1 variant plugin installed. This field must be specified.
#      => no default ordering is assumed.
#
#    - If len(plugins) > 1 and an installed plugin is missing in the priority list => raise ConfigurationError
#
#    - If namespaces is specified by no plugin uses it => warning issued.
